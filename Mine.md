# Halloween in Church

It's Halloween season and the decorations are everywhere, as you can imagine.
I've noticed, however, that churches seem to be ignoring this holiday. Which is
a shame, they could have totally reused their Easter decorations for this one.
Put up Jesus, on the cross, in all gory details, with a crown of thorns and
with blood dripping from the nails -- and you have a perfect Halloween
decoration.

In fact, take pretty much any of the Michelangelo paintings, cut it in half and
the bottom half would be a great Halloween decoration. The Pope and the Clerics
don't even need to change anything: they are already perfectly well dressed up
for Halloween.

# Slow Children

I've seen a sign on my way to work that says "slow children at play" and I
thought: are those children really that slow that you need a special sign?
Also, is the concern that they are so slow that they won't be able to run away
from the car in time or is the concern that they won't understand that the car
is coming? I guess, what I'm asking is: is this a mental or a physical thing?
