# Halloween in Church

It's Halloween season and the decorations are everywhere, as you can imagine.
I've noticed, however, that churches seem to be ignoring this holiday. Which is
a shame, they could have totally reused their Easter decorations for this one.
Put up Jesus, on the cross, in all gory details, with a crown of thorns and
with blood dripping from the nails -- and you have a perfect Halloween
decoration.

In fact, take pretty much any of the Michelangelo paintings, cut it in half and
the bottom half would be a great Halloween decoration.
